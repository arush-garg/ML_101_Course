       "The aim of this investigation is to explore the relationship between the length of a wire and its electrical resistance. The research question guiding this investigation is: How does the length of a wire affect its electrical resistance?\n",
       "\n",
       "### Hypothesis\n",
       "It is hypothesized that as the length of the wire increases, its electrical resistance will also increase. This hypothesis is based on the scientific understanding that the resistance of a conductor is directly proportional to its length, as described by the formula R = ρ(L/A), where R is the resistance, ρ is the resistivity of the material, L is the length, and A is the cross-sectional area.\n",

       "\n",
       "- **Independent Variable:** The length of the wire. This will be changed by cutting the wire to different lengths.\n",
       "- **Dependent Variable:** The electrical resistance of the wire. This will be measured using a multimeter.\n",
       "- **Controlled Variables:**\n",
       "  - Temperature: This will be controlled by ensuring that the experiment is conducted at room temperature and that there is no significant change in temperature during the experiment.\n",
       "  - Material of the wire: The experiment will use a wire of a single material to ensure consistency.\n",
