**Problem Statement:**
How does the length of a wire affect the electrical resistance of the wire?

**Hypothesis:**
Based on the scientific concept of resistance and the relationship between resistance and wire length, I predict that as the length of the wire increases, the electrical resistance also increases. This can be supported by the equation R = ρ(L/A), where R is resistance, ρ is resistivity, L is length, and A is cross-sectional area.

**Variables:**

* Independent Variable: Length of the wire
* Dependent Variable: Electrical resistance
* Controlled Variables: Cross-sectional area of the wire, temperature, and material of the wire

**Materials and Equipment:**

* Wire (variable length)
* Multimeter
* Power source
* Meter ruler
* Pencil and paper

**Method:**

1. Measure the initial length of the wire using a meter ruler.
2. Connect the wire to the multimeter and power source.
3. Set the multimeter to measure resistance.
4. Record the resistance measurement.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 with different lengths of the wire, increasing the length each time.
6. Record the length and corresponding resistance measurements.

**Results:**

| Length (cm) | Resistance (Ω) |

**Conclusion:**
The graph shows a positive linear relationship between the length of the wire and electrical resistance, with a clear increasing trend. This supports the hypothesis that as the length of the wire increases, the electrical resistance also increases. The equation R = ρ(L/A) can be used to describe this relationship.

**Evaluation of the Method:**
The investigation was successful in demonstrating the relationship between wire length and resistance. However, some improvements can be made to the method:

* Using a larger range of wire lengths to increase the accuracy of the results.
* Using a more precise measurement device to reduce error.
* Controlling for any external factors that may affect the resistance measurement.

**Relation to Statement of Inquiry:**
This investigation relates to the statement of inquiry as it demonstrates how understanding the properties of electrical resistance can help us have better control over electric currents and their applications.
