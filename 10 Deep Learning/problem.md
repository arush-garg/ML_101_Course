# Deep Learning Models

The use cases for deep ML models are endless. This week's problem is more open-ended, and you are encouraged to experiment with many different openly available models.

You can also choose to use a different type of model altogether, like Dall-e, a diffusion model used to generate images. You can explore the different models and documentation on [Groq's message](https://console.groq.com/playground)

Please post the project you decide to create in the [video](https://youtu.be/szNnPh1sruY) comments.
