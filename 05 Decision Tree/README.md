Last lesson, we looked at Logistic Regression, and how that is used for Binary Classification.

In this lesson, we will look at Decision Trees, Random Forests and KNN Classifiers to tackle similar classification problems. 

A Decision Tree uses a tree-like structure to make decisions by splitting data into subsets based on feature conditions, ultimately assigning class labels to data points.
