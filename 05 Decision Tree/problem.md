Try the problem presented by the following data set:

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data

The file is inside the data folder and is named **titanic.csv**

You can use the DTree_Animal.ipynb file as a template.

If needed, refer to the DTree_Titanic.ipynb file for my approach to the problem
