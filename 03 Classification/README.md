Classification is a supervised ML task that predicts categorical labels for input data. It's vital for applications like sentiment analysis, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis.

Logistic regression uses a formula on top of linear regression to get a value between 0 and 1, which is usually at either extreme.

Other models for classification include:
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

Instead of Root Mean Squared Error, classification models are usually measured on metrics like accuracy, precision and recall.
