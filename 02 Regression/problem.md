# Grade Prediction

Try the problem presented by the following data set:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption

The file is inside the data folder and is named **grades_clean.csv** 

(This data has been cleaned further using the code in GradesCleaning.ipynb. Details about the new columns is in info.md)

You can use the code from SAT prediction problem as a template.

If needed, refer to the GradePrediction.ipynb file for my approach to the problem

Keep in mind that my solution may have concepts that have not been covered yet.
