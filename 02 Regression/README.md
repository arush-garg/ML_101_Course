This lesson is intended to focus on the simplest Machine Learning model, Linear Regression.

It includes two problems:
1. A notebook called GPA_SAT.ipynb to get started
2. The problem mentioned in problem.md, to try what you have learnt. GradesPrediction.ipynb is my solution to the problem, in case you need help.
