This lesson is intended to focus on the simplest Machine Learning model, Linear Regression.

It includes two problems:
1. A notebook called `GPA_SAT.ipynb` to get started

- I have also included `Exp_GPA_SAT.ipynb` to help you with using an exponential trend (exercise from `GPA_SAT.ipynb`).

2. The problem mentioned in `problem.md`, to try what you have learnt. `GradesPrediction.ipynb` is my solution to the problem, in case you need something to reference.
