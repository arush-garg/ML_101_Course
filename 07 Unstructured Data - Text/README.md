So far, we have been using tabular (structured) data for all classification and regression problems.

In this lesson, we will look at dealing with text, which is considered unstructured data. Stand-alone models usually cannot handle the large feature spaces that text data has, hence we will learn about a new type of model: Support Vector Machines (SVM).
