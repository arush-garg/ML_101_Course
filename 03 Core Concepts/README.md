This lesson is intended to focus on the steps of Machine Learning that actually take time - Data Cleaning and Preparation.

This lesson has one practical file called NonNum.ipynb. In this file, you will clean a dataset about student grades and save the clean file to a csv so that it can be used to train an ML model.
