# Spam Filter

Try the problem presented by the following data set:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karthickveerakumar/spam-filter/code

The file is inside the data folder and is named **emails.csv** 

The problem is a binary classification task, where 0 = Not spam and 1 = Spam.

This is the same problem as last lesson, but use a Neural Network this time to solve the problem.

You can use the Neural_TextClassification.ipynb file as a template.

If needed, refer to the Neural_SpamFilter.ipynb file for my approach to the problem
