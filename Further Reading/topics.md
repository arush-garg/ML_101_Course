This course just scratches the surface of machine learning.

To learn more, check out some of the topics below!

1. Ada Boosting (ensemble model)

This is another form of decision tree ensemble, where each subsequent model tries to predict the error of the previous one. This can give it very high accuracy, but increases the training and response duration.

2. Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

This model is very effective for classification problems. It tries to learn a hyper plane that divides the points of each class. Any new point is placed in the multi-dimensional space and it's position in respect to the hyper plane determines the prediction.

3. Feature Engineering

This is a technique in which new features are created by performing operations on existing ones. For example, a new feature could be the square of another feature so that the model can learn exponential patterns.
