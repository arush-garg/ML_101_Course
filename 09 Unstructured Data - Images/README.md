Last lesson, we looked at the simplest neural network architecture: 

Fully connected neural networks, also known as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

However, in this lesson, we will learn about their limitations in terms of efficiency and accuracy for image-related problems.

Instead, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are much faster and better at solving these kinds of problems. To learn more about how they work, please watch the video for this lesson.
