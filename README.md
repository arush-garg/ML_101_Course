## Course Description

Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field that plays a crucial role in various domains such as finance, healthcare, marketing, and more. This course will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of machine learning and guide you through building a strong understanding of key techniques.

We will start with the basics, including linear regression, and gradually move towards more advanced topics like simple neural networks. By the end of this course, you will have the knowledge and skills to apply machine learning algorithms to real-world problems and kickstart your journey in the field of artificial intelligence.

We believe in learning by doing, hence almost all lessons have a practical exercise in them. In addition, some lessons have a problem that you should try to solve after going through the content for that lesson.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this course, you should have:

- A basic understanding of mathematics
- A curious and problem-solving mindset.

We will be using Python and Jupyter Notebooks throughout the course, so it would be best if you have some experience with programming, especially in Python.
