In this lesson, we will touch upon models and concepts beyond Supervised Learning.

#### Unsupervised Learning

In general, Unsupervised Learning is when a model find patterns from the data without having explicit labels.

#### K-means Clustering

Clustering is when the model segregates data points into different groups based on their distances in an n-dimensional space. One very popular algorithm used for clustering is K-means Clustering.

K is the number of clusters, and can be one of the hyperparameters. The model randomly initialises points and moves the centres of the groups until the distance is minimised.

#### Recommender Systems

Recommendation algorithms are used widely on various platforms, from e-commerce to streaming. One way to do this is using Matrix Factorisation. 

Given the sparse matrix of users and movies, the matrix is factorised into a user matrix and movie matrix. This is done in a manner such that when multiplied, they give a matrix very close to the original matrix. 

Using these "embeddings", we can predict which movies the user would rate highly.

#### Generative AI (GANs)
