# Wine Quality Prediction

Try the problem presented by the following data set:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset

The file is inside the data folder and is named **WineQT.csv** 

Using chemical test data on wines, predict their quality between 0 (very poor) and 10 (excellent).
Use GridSerch to find the best hyperparameters, and make sure to try with a variety of models. You can even try using Linear Regression, and using np.round() to get a whole number. But be sure to use Accuracy as the metric, not RMSE.

You can use the CarClassification.ipynb file as a template.

If needed, refer to the WineQuality.ipynb file for my approach to the problem
